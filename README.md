<h1>Wordpress Theme</h1>

<h1>Summary</h1>
<hr>
<p>Wordpress Theme based off Brad Schiff's amazing Udemy course 'Become a Wordpress Developer'</p>

<h1>Usage</h1>
<hr>
<p>Throughout the course I used Local By Flywheel as my local server environment. Alternatively MAMP, XAMPP can be used. Use Gulp to compile
the CSS and Javascript.
The following Wordpress plugins are recommended to use :
<ul>
  <li>Advanced Custom Fields by Elliot Condon</li>
  <li>Manual Image Crop by Tomasz Sita</li>
  <li>Members by Justin Tadlock</li>
  <li>Regenerate Thumbnails by Alex Mills</li>
</ul>
<p>It also contains a file 'university-post-types.php' for all the custom post types for the website.
